## What is SurveyChampion?

We are using Agile to replicate real dev environments.

In this project, as a user you can: 
- Create surveys
- Take surveys
- Analyse survey data

## What's left?

- Adding user authentication for owning surveys.
- Overall improve user experience by testing users' needs.
